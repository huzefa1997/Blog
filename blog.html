	<h2> SOLO The Smart Drone </h2>
	<p class="quote">
		The IT System in this drone, mainly involves the use of a GoPro camera that is able tor record HD Videos and stream it to your device. This particular drone allows you to stream HD Videos to you IOS/ Android device too. It uses, Smart Shot technology which makes capturing incredible cinematic footage easy. It can also capture HD aerial shots easily. A 1GHZ computer is on board that allows the drone to function. The computer chip makes the drone 'SMART' this allows the drone to be highly responsive and flexible to different tasks. A Smart battery with an LED indicator is present to power this drone. having it connected to your phone, adds a plethora of different features to this drone. There are unique features like 'safety net' that make this drone safe to fly. There are software updates on a regular basis to keep the companion app out of bugs and glitches and update with any latest additions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Reliability of these drones is something which could be of concern. Although it comes loaded with features. The efficiency of all these features working together and interacting with one and other is something which is questionable. For instance if one of the motors shuts down or malfunctions the drone could potentially fall down and cause damage to someone. Moreover, the range of the drone, if it goes out of range would the user will lose control of the drone. In this case, the drone could be potentially harmful. The drones could be used as means of Surveillance. This is an issue to he people being looked it. They would be concerned about their personal space and invading privacy as these drones would be able to keep track of their activities. Most people would not liked to be kept track of in such a way. Moreover, they would be concerned about the safety as drones constantly flying overhead could carry the risk of failing and crashing down.It could also be mistaken for being other objects, that may be considered as highly dangerous by people. As many people today are not aware of these drones, and seeing an object shaped like that could concern them about the security of these drones.

	<h2>Robots to staff a self-titled 'Strange Hotel' in Japan</h2>
	<p class="quote">
		 This robot functions using about 43 actuators for all the movement that it can conduct. It is classified as a 'humanoid robot' because of its ability to have human like emotions and expressions. But also, its has a very realistic skin texture and eye movement making it the closest robot to mankind. This humanoid robot is the product of a operation algorithm that Toshiba developed for multi joint robots which also allows the operation of the 43 actuators smoothly. It has the motion teaching technology which works with motion sensors and the application of robot driving technologies. It contains special pattern recognition software that allows the robot to retrieve an array of human like expressions. Its face contains micro-pores that have about 40 nanometers that allow it to functions. Motors in its lips that carry out minor movements and adjust the points of articulation enable the robot to smile. The language processor allows it to comprehend simple questions and make responses to them accordingly. 
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the major issues is going to be with the Reliability of the robot and also like to the People and Machines issue too. Since this hotel is going to be replacing all its staff with the robots they must firstly make sure ho comfortable people are as to being interacting entirely with robots. Also these robots could easily break down or malfunction, in case this happens the hotel may incur high cost due to the maintenance of these robots. Also the customers may be unhappy of the service being provided by the hotel if these robots tend to make any mistakes. For example: if food is ordered at room serve and is being brought by the robot they could potentially drop the food etc. happening like this would create a negative atmosphere in the hotel and directly impact the customer satisfaction. However, these robots may intact be very efficient and perfect with what they'd o. As they could process an hotel reservation immediately. this would save the customers the waiting period in the lobby for their rooms to be assigned. Furthermore, these robots could escort the customers to their room and carry their baggage too, but the kind of interaction actual human staff would make with he customer would not be achieved by these robots too! The increase amounts of maintain costs for the robots could lead to the fact that some malfunctioned robots may intact be disposed of and new ones could be bought straight away this would then lead on to the issue of E-watse. The fact that so much technology would be disposed off because buying new one seems more beneficial in long term is harmful to the environment due some of the toxic metals being deposited by this waste. Since so much of the processing could be handled by robots. Much of the computers and systems maybe disposed too. this would further increase the issue of E waste. Since all the human staff would be sacked it would create negative link on effect for the hospitality industry. Also, these robots could be used to help patients in hospitals.  This could concern many people as they may not want to trust their life in the hands of these humanoids. On the other hand ChihiraAico can sing and play musical instruments makes it good for entrainment purposes in the hotel too. However, there are other humanoids that are programmed to do much complex tasks and much more advanced than this one  and are being used in different industries like Pepper as Softbanks personal companion. Lastly ChihariAico can be used for elderly people with a condition like dementia and be connected to a councillor or doctor. this would allow the old people to be taken care of appropriately however, if they ar being entirely reliant on them in conditions when this malfunctions they would be stranded.

	<h2>Amazon reveals cloud powered machine learning services for app developers</h2>

	<p class="quote">
		Machine Learning is basically an Artificial Intelligence technique that allows computers to learn themselves without them being actually programmed to do so. It mainly focuses on computer programs that can grow and teach themselves from data that is input by users. Machine learning algorithms discover patterns in data and build mathematical models using these patterns. This then allows users to use these models to make prediction on new data. For instance on a shopping website a machine learning algorithm could record your buying patterns and see the kind of products you search. It then is able to produce the kind of items you want and presents suggested items to the users. It generally works on past data to predict the future actions. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Amazons new service will allow any app developer to produce applications that work on machine learning and can make predictions. This brings up the issue of the Reliability of these applications. The fact that any app developer can develop these applications as they do not need to know the algorithm thats meant to be entered into this application. As amazon's service will do it for you. This allows a larger group of App Developers to produce applications as such. The increase in number of applications like these could raise the concern of which one to actually use. It would make app developers in one sense compete against each other. However, from the consumers point of view they may be unsure as to which of these applications could be the most reliable ones. Another thing would be the intensions of App developers. Some may use this out of bad intention and actually use the data the application collects to predict something completely against what the pattern says. This would obviously be achieved by tweaking the algorithm. However, the genius algorithm that scientists and mathematicians have put together will be eradicated. People could also face problems when they see predictions being made of something inappropriate making people think that, what they were searching for was something like that! Also in the case of a stock exchange prediction. Usually threes no relevance of a stock price to what its past results were. People could potentially end up losing a lot of money if they were to solely rely on a system like this. Another issue is the Privacy of the users. Many people may not want the computer making predictions on what they are searching for and doing. As it may be something that they want to keep as personal knowledge. Same thing with youtube when it bring up suggested videos on your home page. Some people may just not want others to see what their interest lay upon. Because, at the end of the day what the want is just a simple search away. Another thing to consider is that fact that all the data that this AI technique receives is from the user. What we are basically doing is creating a system that is much more powerful and smart or eventually may become smarter than humans. It does have its benefits like how when you have things being predicted to you on shopping websites it gives you information on new products to look into before buying one. Also the fact that teachers could actually use this AI technique to provide students with predicted grades based on their past test results. The list goes on. However, a small tweak in these algorithms could put all this data that makes the system powerful at stake! One way to get past issues as such would be integrate security within these systems so the data that they collect over time is actually safe. And to inform people on the benefits this system bring to users so they are not hesitant when the privacy factor comes in.
